### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**snqlp/snqlp** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on dexterclassroom.com, a learning portal for kids.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Pragramming & Data Science from IIT Madras.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on basic projects to enhance my programming skills.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building my own website.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ''How's the Josh''
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: snqlparora@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: ''Code cannot code its own code''.
